Final Project for Cloud Computing CS 5412

This is the front end application for a custom spotify song recommendation system. 

Users can sync with friends and add songs to a playlist. Then our recommendation system will generate new songs based on the previous list that it thinks all the users will enjoy and play the song on the web!
